-----------------

**EZPZ Plotting** is a Python program that allows the user to easily create, view, and manipulate multiple plots from multiple files at once.

# Main features

- Takes multiple data files as input, and is able to make multiple plots from each file
- Effortlessly "flip" through what I refer to as the *Flipbook*, where each page is a different plot
- Manipulate each plot individually - for example, you can adjust axes limits or add a background

# How to get it

Clone this repository and run *main.py*.
So far, *this program only works on Windows machines* - I will be adding support for other operating systems in the future.

## Dependencies

- [lemons](https://github.com/jakebrehm/lemons)
- [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)
- [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
- [configobj](https://github.com/DiffSK/configobj)

The **lemons** package is my own creation, and it is mainly used for GUI-related purposes. **Matplotlib** is used for plotting, **pandas** is used for data parsing, and **configobj** is used for saving and loading of presets.
