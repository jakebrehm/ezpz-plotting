The following is a list of features that I want to add to **EZPZ Plotting**. Eventually, I want to add all features; however, since I am only one person, I can only add one thing at a time. Therefore, features that I feel are absolutely necessary before the first full release of the program (high), features that I would like to add eventually (medium), and features that may never be added or are unnecessary (low) are differentiated.

The list will be ordered from highest priority to lowest priority.
